# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to help note down the main things learnt regarding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git in an orderly and clear manner. It can be used to easily recap the information taught within the prework. The creation of this study guide has also helped me to put these coding languages into practise to create my own application.
